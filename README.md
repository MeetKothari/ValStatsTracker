# Welcome!
As someone who enjoys playing Valorant and has a passion for data, I found multiple faults in the integrity of the algorithm used on tracker.gg, and sought to make one that's better. This repo contains the code for that. This is currently a WIP, though you can find current functionality in the 'commands.txt' file which is provided in this repo.
# Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and a number of Python libraries. You can look in the requirements.txt file for a comprehensive compendium, and you can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

I recommend using a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment by running the following commands:

`python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate`

After activating the virtual environment, you can install the required packages by running: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt.`
